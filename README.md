# flashcard

This is Flash card to memorize words. It provides you card based on the difficulty.
It is based on https://github.com/RafaelBroseghini/Flask-Cards.git by RafaelBroseghini, having said that I have added loads of features. 
For example:
*1- hourly notification to memorize more.
*2- show random next cards
*3- shows card difficulty
*4- you rate if you know words which leads to decrese the difficulty 
*and many more...
